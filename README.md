# Model Fitness Gym's Customer Interaction & Retention Strategy üèãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüí™üèª

The Model Fitness Gym chain is developing a customer interaction strategy based on analytical data.

One of the most common problems that gyms and other services face is customer churn. How do we know if a customer is no longer with you? We can calculate turnover based on people who get rid of their accounts or don't renew their contracts. However, sometimes it's not obvious that a customer has left: they can sneak out.

Turnover indicators varies from area to area. If a user buys from an online store rarely but regularly, we can't say you're a runaway. But if for two weeks they didn't open the channel that is updated daily, that's a reason to worry: the follower may have been upset and left.

For a gym, it makes sense to say that customers have left if they haven't shown up in a month. Of course, it is possible that they are in Cancun and will come to frequent again when they return, but this is not a common case. Usually, if a customer joins, comes a few times, then disappears, they probably won't come back.

Instead of struggling with churn, Model Fitness digitized a portion of customer profiles. The task is to analyze them and come up with a customer retention strategy.

Must:

- Learn how to predict the likelihood of churn (for the next month) for each customer

- Draw portraits of typical users: select the most striking groups and describe their main characteristics

- Analyze the factors that most impact turnover

- Draw basic conclusions and develop recommendations on how to improve customer service:

- Identify target groups

- Suggest measures to decrease turnover

- Describe any other patterns you see regarding customer interactions
